# FruitHub.github.io

FruitHub emerges as a modern marketplace dedicated solely to fresh fruits. By offering users the ability to browse, purchase, and learn more about various fruit products, we aim to bridge the gap between fruit enthusiasts and premium quality produce.

## Project Objective

Our platform stands out by integrating user feedback in the form of comments and by allowing users to subscribe for regular fruit deliveries, ensuring they never run out of their favorites. Each product detail page is meticulously designed to provide comprehensive information about the fruit, along with promoting related fruit products, thus giving users an enhanced shopping experience.

## Features

1) Customers: User authentication
Customers can register for a personal account to track their orders, manage their subscriptions, and maintain a profile. This secure system ensures users' data is safeguarded and enhances the personalized shopping experience.

2) Customers: Add, remove fruit from the shopping carts
Once logged in, users can seamlessly add their favorite fruits to their shopping cart. They also have the freedom to modify their cart by removing items if they change their mind.

3) Customers: Subscription fruit order
For those who wish for regular fruit deliveries, there's an option to subscribe. Users can choose the frequency of their orders, ensuring they always have fresh produce at their disposal.

4) Customers: Leave comments
After making a purchase, users are encouraged to leave comments on the product. This feedback helps other customers make informed choices and helps sellers improve their products and services.

5) Customers: Product search functionality
To enhance the shopping experience, customers can utilize a powerful search bar feature. This tool allows them to quickly and efficiently find specific fruits or varieties they are interested in.
