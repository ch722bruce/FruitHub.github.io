## Project Objective

Our platform stands out by integrating user feedback in the form of comments and by allowing users to subscribe for regular fruit deliveries, ensuring they never run out of their favorites. Each product detail page is meticulously designed to provide comprehensive information about the fruit, along with promoting related fruit products, thus giving users an enhanced shopping experience.

## Features

1) Customers: User Authentication
Customers can register for a personal account to track their orders, manage their subscriptions, and maintain a profile. This secure system ensures users' data is safeguarded and enhances the personalized shopping experience.

2) Customers: Add, remove fruit from the shopping carts
Once logged in, users can seamlessly add their favorite fruits to their shopping cart. They also have the freedom to modify their cart by removing items if they change their mind.

3) Customers: Subscription fruit order
For those who wish for regular fruit deliveries, there's an option to subscribe. Users can choose the frequency of their orders, ensuring they always have fresh produce at their disposal.

4) Customers: Leave comments
After making a purchase, users are encouraged to leave comments on the product. This feedback helps other customers make informed choices and helps sellers improve their products and services.

## Installation

Clone the repository and then do:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Which will start the backend server, running on <http://localhost:3000>.



### Frontend

The express application will serve the compiled react application hosted on [./front](./front) folder. If you want to recompile it just run

```bash
npm install
npm install react-router-dom@6
npm run build
```

On the font folder. You can also start a secondary development server for the front end using `npm run dev` on the [./front](./front)  folder courtesy of vite, which will serve the front via <http://localhost:5173>

```bash
npm run dev
```
